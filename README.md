# introduction
the full-connected neural network implement based numpy. I code the linear and relu layer with forward/backward operation while the optimizer is vanilla sgd or Adam. Finally I use the mnist, an image classification task to check the fcnn.

# Notices
this repo contains four dataset files(mnist dataset), so git clone command may take a few time, please be patient.

# environment
python(3.9.12), numpy(1.21.5)

# Usage
git clone and then:
python mnist_train.py

# result
after training mnist model about 1 hour, testset acc is about 0.97
