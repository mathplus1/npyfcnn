# introduction
the full-connected neural network implement only use numpy. I code the linear and relu layer with forward and backward operation while the optimizer is vanilla sgd or Adam.

# environment
python(3.9.12), numpy(1.21.5)

# Usage
git clone and then:
python mnist_train.py

# result
after training mnist model about 1 hour, testset acc is about 0.983
